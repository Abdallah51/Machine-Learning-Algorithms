# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand and implement fundamental machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in Python using popular libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The code is well-commented and includes example datasets for easy experimentation.

# Algorithms Overview
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the algorithms included in this repository:

Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values using a linear approach.

Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems.

Confusion Matrix: A tool to evaluate the performance of classification models.

Decision Tree: A tree-like model for classification and regression.

Random Forest: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classifier for both linear and non-linear data.

K-Means Clustering: An unsupervised algorithm for clustering data into groups.

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA): Reduces the number of features while preserving variance.
